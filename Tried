If s is the character 'a' repeated some number of times, there is no solution. Otherwise, I claim either 'a' + s or s + 'a' is a solution (or both).

Let's prove it. Assume for contradiction that 'a' + s and s + 'a' are both palindromes. Then the first and last characters of s are 'a'. 
Then the second and second to last characters of s are 'a'. Repeating this, we see that all characters of s are 'a', but we assumed we are not in this case. 
Therefore, the claim is true.

The solution is simply to check if 'a' + s and s + 'a' are palindromes and output the correct one. Complexity is O(n).
